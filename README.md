# Browser Monitoring PoC - Exam Edition 🕵️‍♂️🌐


In the age of digital surveillance, just how much can a browser deduce about user activity? The **Browser Monitoring PoC - Exam Edition** is a deep dive into this very question. With the backdrop of an online exam scenario, we explore the boundaries of user monitoring to see just how "private" our interactions are.

## 🌟 Features

- **Tab Activity Monitoring**: Discover when users stray away from the main tab.
- **Live Webcam & Microphone Streams**: Understand real-time user interactions and surroundings.
- **Device Detection**: Identify which devices users have connected.
- **Instant User Activity Log**: Real-time logging of user actions for granular insights.
  
## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Tailwind CSS**: Crafting the UI with utility-first magic.
