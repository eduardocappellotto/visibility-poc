In the age of digital surveillance, just how much can a browser deduce about user activity? The **Browser Monitoring PoC - Exam Edition** is a deep dive into this very question. With the backdrop of an online exam scenario, we explore the boundaries of user monitoring to see just how "private" our interactions are.

## üõ°Ô∏è User Consent Alert

In the realm of online exams and e-learning, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of users is paramount. This proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates some of the potential ways to monitor user activity during an online examination. However, it's crucial to underline the importance of user privacy and consent when employing such monitoring mechanisms.

### Why is User Consent Vital?

1. **Legal Requirements**: Many jurisdictions have robust privacy laws that require explicit user consent before collecting or processing their data. GDPR in the European Union and CCPA in California, USA are prime examples.

2. **Trustworthiness**: Informing users transparently about what is being monitored and why, reinforces trust. It signifies respect for their privacy and autonomy.

3. **Educational Integrity**: For an online exam or learning platform, integrity is key. When users understand the reasons behind such monitoring, it reinforces the sanctity of the examination process.

### Our Consent Mechanism

Upon visiting our platform, users are greeted with a clear and unambiguous alert at the top of the page. This alert:

- Informs users about the tracking and monitoring methods employed.
- Clearly states the educational reasons behind such monitoring.
- Requires users to provide explicit consent before they can proceed.

By adopting this approach, we aim to strike a balance between maintaining exam integrity and respecting user privacy. We believe that a transparent and consensual relationship with users is the foundation for any credible e-learning platform.

**Disclaimer**: While we have built a user consent mechanism, it's essential to adapt it to specific regional and local legal requirements. We strongly recommend consulting with legal professionals when deploying such systems.
